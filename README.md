# 💼 Loan Recovery Dashboard (Power BI Project)

## 🎯 Project Objective
To **design and implement a Loan Recovery Performance Dashboard** in Power BI that converts raw financial data into actionable insights for collection managers.

This dashboard enables data-driven decisions by identifying **high-risk loans**, analyzing **collection performance**, and segmenting **losses by borrower demographics**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Design an **interactive Loan Recovery Dashboard** with Power BI.
- Create **effective data models** and custom **DAX measures** (e.g., Recovery Rate).
- Visualize and segment risk based on **loan type, age, and employment type**.
- Prioritize **high-value, high-delinquency loans** to optimize collection efforts.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
| Tool / Technology | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Power BI Desktop** | Data modeling, DAX, and visualization design |
| **Python / Pandas** | Data acquisition and quality check of raw CSV |
| **Microsoft Excel / CSV** | Source format for loan recovery dataset |
| **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** | Custom measures and KPIs for performance analysis |

**Visualization Techniques:**
- 📊 **Scatter Plot** — Risk and Delinquency Prioritization  
- 🍩 **Donut Chart** — Loan Recovery Status Distribution  
- 📈 **Bar Chart** — Loss Segmentation and Loan Type Insights  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition:** Loaded the loan recovery dataset (CSV).
2. **Data Cleaning & Modeling:** Validated data types and created relationships for performance.
3. **Measure Creation (DAX):** Defined KPIs like Recovery Rate, Written Off Amount, etc.
4. **Visualization & Layout:** Designed three dashboard pages —  
   - Loan Health Overview  
   - Risk & Delinquency Analysis  
   - Loss Segmentation
5. **Insight Generation:** Used visuals like scatter plots to identify top-priority collection cases.

## 📉 Problem Statement
### The Challenge:
Management lacked a real-time view of loan health, causing inefficient collection operations.

### Key Issues:
- No quick overview of **total outstanding loan amount at risk**.
- No mechanism to identify **high-value, high-delinquency loans**.
- Lack of **segmentation by employment type or loan category**.

---

## ✅ Solution: Interactive Power BI Dashboard
### Key Features:
- **KPI Cards:** Display overall Recovery Rate and total Written Off Amount.  
- **Risk Heatmap (Scatter Plot):** Identify and prioritize high-risk loans.  
- **Strategic Segmentation:** Analyze Written Off Loans by Loan Type & Employment Type.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Views
1. **Loan Health Overview:**  
   - Loan Recovery Status Distribution (Donut Chart)  
   - Outstanding Amount by Loan Type (Bar Chart)

2. **Risk & Delinquency Analysis:**  
   - Delinquency Scatter Plot (Risk Heatmap)

3. **Loss Segmentation:**  
   - Written Off Loans by Employment Type (Bar Chart)

---

## 🚀 Business Impact
- Empowered collection managers to **focus on highest-risk loans** (high value + delinquent).
- Highlighted that **Salaried borrowers** contributed to the majority of written-off losses.
- Enabled **data-driven strategies** to reduce losses and improve operational efficiency.
